## Description üìÑ

This Hangman game selects a random word from a predefined list and displays a series of underscores representing the hidden letters of the word. Players must guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the word or the hangman drawing is completed.

## How to Play üé≤

1. The game will randomly select a secret word from a list of words.
2. The secret word will be represented by underscores `_`.
3. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
4. If the guessed letter is in the secret word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
5. If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, a part of the hangman will be drawn.
6. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or the hangman drawing is complete.
7. If the hangman drawing is complete before you guess the word, the game is over, and you lose.
8. If you guess the word before the hangman drawing is complete, you win!
9. After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again.
